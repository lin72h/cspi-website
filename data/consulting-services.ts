      question: "How do I know if my current business structure is optimal?",
      questionZh: "我如何知道我当前的业务结构是否最优？",
      answer: "Many businesses operate under structures that were established at startup without considering long-term implications. Signs that your structure may not be optimal include paying more tax than necessary, inadequate asset protection, limited flexibility for growth, or complications with bringing in new owners/investors. Our assessment can identify if your current structure is serving your business well or if restructuring would be beneficial.",
      answerZh: "许多企业在创立初期建立结构时没有考虑长期影响。您的结构可能不是最优的迹象包括：支付过多的税款、资产保护不足、增长灵活性有限或引入新所有者/投资者时出现复杂情况。我们的评估可以确定您当前的结构是否有效服务于您的业务，或者重组是否有益。"
