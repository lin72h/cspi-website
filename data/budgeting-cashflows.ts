  faqs: [
    {
      id: 1,
      question: "How detailed should our company budget be?",
      answer: "The ideal level of budget detail depends on your business size, complexity, and goals. Generally, we recommend breaking down revenue by product/service lines and major customer segments, while expenses should be categorized by department and key expense types. For small businesses, we typically develop budgets with 20-30 line items, while larger operations may require 50+ categories. The key is finding the right balance between sufficient detail for meaningful analysis without creating an overly cumbersome process."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "How far in advance should we forecast cash flows?",
      answer: "We typically recommend a tiered approach to cash flow forecasting: detailed weekly forecasts for the next 1-3 months, monthly forecasts for the remainder of the year, and quarterly forecasts for the following year. This provides the immediate visibility needed for day-to-day management while supporting longer-term planning. For businesses with high seasonality or significant growth plans, we may adjust this timeframe to ensure adequate planning horizons."
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "What are the warning signs of potential cash flow problems?",
      answer: "Key warning signs include: consistently decreasing cash reserves, regularly paying bills late, heavy reliance on overdrafts or credit lines, extending payment terms to customers, shrinking profit margins, rapid growth without corresponding cash increases, and increasing inventory levels without sales growth. Our cashflow management services help identify these issues early and implement corrective measures before they become critical problems."
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "How often should budgets be reviewed and updated?",
      answer: "We recommend monthly budget reviews for most businesses, with a more comprehensive quarterly reassessment. This allows for timely identification of variances while providing sufficient time for corrective actions. The annual budget should be developed 1-2 months before your fiscal year begins, with formal mid-year adjustments if significant changes in business conditions occur. This balanced approach maintains accountability while allowing for necessary flexibility."
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "Can you help with raising capital or securing financing?",
      answer: "Yes, our budgeting and cashflow services directly support capital raising and financing efforts. We develop professional-quality financial projections, cashflow forecasts, and financial statements that meet lender and investor requirements. We can help identify optimal financing structures, determine appropriate funding amounts, and prepare compelling financial presentations that demonstrate your business's viability and growth potential."
